          <h3>&#9203; 2017</h3>
          <p>Asylum Cafe first opened its doors on June 14, 2017, in a cozy corner of the city. Born from a love of good coffee, great food, and even better company, it started as a tiny passion project with just six tables, one espresso machine, and a dream. Over the years, we’ve grown into a beloved neighborhood spot where regulars know the staff by name and newcomers feel right at home.</p>

          <h3>&#127919; Purpose</h3>
          <p>The name Asylum isn’t a warning — it’s a promise. We’re a safe haven for caffeine addicts, dessert lovers, and anyone escaping from the chaos of daily life. Our goal? To serve food so good it feels a little bit crazy not to order seconds, and coffee strong enough to make Monday mornings almost tolerable.</p>
